* My latex writing templates for org-mode

This repo contains different templates as a starter code to write org-mode which can later be exported to latex and pdf.


* Emacs settings

I am using [[https://github.com/seagle0128/.emacs.d][Centaur Emacs]] for my emacs setting,
so if you encounter any different exporting result, please refer to the emacs setting or my [[https://github.com/GeneKao/.emacs.d][fork]] version.

* Export from .org file to .pdf

Use the key combination

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
C-c C-e l o
#+END_SRC

For more information, please refer to the [[https://orgmode.org/guide/LaTeX-and-PDF-export.html][official documentation]].
